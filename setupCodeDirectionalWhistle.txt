Sound source localization with Agents
SETUP:
- Set up NAOs on field in random location
- Determine locations NAOs relative to 0,0. 0,0 is middle of field
- Listen for tone
- Hear/recognize sound
	*Do not use microphone with longest delay

Active:
- Determine the 2 possible locations with the 3 microphones; 
	*Determine 3 functions of possible location of source.
	*Determine linear part of function. 
	*Combos: 12, 13, 23
	*-Get two points on the function line on the linear part.
- Translate function coordinates to field coordinates function
- Get intersections of functions. Guess/determine the closest intersections 
	*-Get two points on the function line on the linear part.
	*Use library or self written intersection function.
- Calculate average location from the intersections
	*-Use heuristics to determine + or - from function?
- Determine angle based on the average location 

Ending:
- List angle & distance/location for each whistle
- Determine whether the whistle was in field or out field.
- Compare outcomes to actual values to determine score.

Workflow:
- Create code to determine location
- Create 2 multiple regression models, one for location, one for in field classification, inputs are sound delay & current location
- Ask/get location data
- Create sound delay data
- Run the code/models
